## Introduction
Singlepage.js is a pure Javascript portal platform for building modular Web applications. The platform is composed of three components: 
- CLI for bootstrapping, developing, and deploying applications
- UI composition framework for constructing Web applications from Vue.js components
- Web services framework for developing backend services

### Singlepage CLI
- Create minimal or full app boilerplate
- Development support via "singlepage serve" that serves from memory and uses livereload for hot reloads
- Build app distribution for deployment

### Application Composition Framework
- Interactive creation of Web application via drag-n-drop of Vue.js components
- Component customization via auto-generated property editor
- Support for custom component commands and property editor
- Look & feel customization via CSS files and component window style overrides
- Built-in page grid layouts with the ability to define your own
- Internationalization via global message file as well as embedded component-specific messages

### Web Services Framework
- Service communication via HTTP/JSON
- Support for developing and adding application-specific services
- Role based access control
- Default implmentation of core services

## Quick Start

### Installation
Install `singlepage-js` globally.
```
npm install -g singlepage-js
```
### Application Setup
Global installation of singlepage-js provides the `singlepage` command that can be used to generate application boilerplate and serve your application. 

```
# Create app boilerplate
singlepage create myapp

# Change to myapp directory and start serving boilerplate application
cd myapp
singlepage serve

```
### View Application
Open a Web browser and access your application on http://localhost:8080. 

### Edit Application
Click on the Login button on the top right corner. Use admin/admin as your username/password. The Login button will be replaced by a button that shows current user information. Click on the button and select `Turn on Edit Mode`. This will show editing commands in the same dropdown. It also shows a gear icon and a drag icon on each portal window (component). The following is a quick summary of supported edit operations:

- Add Component: Each column in the grid shows a select box with `Add` button next to it. Select the component you want to add from the select dropdown and click `Add` to add that component to the column
- Edit Component Properties: Click on the gear icon on a portal window and select "Edit Settings" to set component properties
- Delete Component: Select "Delete Component" from the portal window menu 
- Rearrange Components: You can drag and drop components by clicking on the drag icon on the portal window
- Add Page: Select "New Page" from the top right dropdown and enter requested page metadata
- Delete Page: Select "Delete Current Page" from the top level dropdown
- Change Page Order: Drag and drop the top menubar page links to the desired position
- Add Folder: Open Page Manager by selecting `Page Manager` option from the top portal menu and click on "New Folder" button


### Deploy Application
Use `build` command to create your distribution. The distribution is created in the `dist` folder under your application directory. You can use `spstart.js`  script in the `bin` directory to run the server.

```
cd myapp
singlepage build
node ./dist/bin/spstart.js
```
You can simply copy the dist directory to your production environment to deploy it. Additional steps such as installing node and running `npm install` may be needed depending on your hosting provider and your method of deployment.
